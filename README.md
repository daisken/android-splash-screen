* To make the splash animation behavior easier to understand, the duration is intentionally set longer.
* The following file contains "TODO" as what you need to do :)

1. build.gradle(app)
2. res/drawable/check_animation.xml (AnimatedVectorDrawable xml)
3. res/values/themes
4. AndroidManifest.xml
5. MainActivity.kt
